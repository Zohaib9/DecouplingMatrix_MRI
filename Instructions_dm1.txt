Step 1: Download, extract 'DecouplingMatrix_MRI.zip' 

Step 2: run demo.m in `DecouplingMatrix_MRI' to explore various features

Step 3: A computed decoupling matrix is saved in a spice netlist '.sp' 
	with a user provided name. This file can be directly
	imported in commercial circuit simulators.

Step 4: Open the spice netlist '.sp' in any word processing software to 
	inspect the values of capacitors and inductors
